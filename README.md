## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To get this project running on your local machine, follow the steps mentioned below.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can verify if you have these installed by running the following commands in your terminal/command prompt:

    npm -v

If these commands return versions, then you have the necessary installations to proceed. If not, please install Node.js and npm first.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository

Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the folder where you want to clone the repository. Run the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/AGuyNamedDJ/Health-Hive-Back-End.git

2. Navigate to the project directory

   cd health_hive_back_end

3. Install dependencies

   Once you're in the root directory of the project, install the required dependencies by running:

   npm install

This command will install all the project's dependencies mentioned in the package.json file, including React, React-DOM, bcrypt, cors, dotenv, and others.

4. Start the server

Once all the dependencies are installed, you can start the server:

    npm start

This will start the server and the website should be available at localhost:3000 (or a port that your terminal indicates).

Note: If changes are made to the package.json file, you will need to stop the server (Ctrl + C in the terminal), reinstall the dependencies (npm install), and then start the server again (npm start).

Please ensure you have the necessary access rights and permissions when performing the above operations. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the 'issues' section of the repository.
